I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich, specializing in Computer Vision. I’m currently writing my thesis with the [Computer Vision Group](https://cvg.cit.tum.de/publications). Prior to this, I earned a double major degree in Mathematics and Computer Engineering from Bogazici University in 2022.

My research interests lie in 3D/4D generation and reconstruction, as well as in 3D shape analysis and matching.
